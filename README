GRUNT
- AngularJS App app/dvconfig.js is grunted from src/*
- edit src and use grunt to concat dvconfig.js (see http://gruntjs.com/)
- see Gruntfile.js
- folder node_modules is grunt stuff as well

./ServerCode
- here you find some php files, that initialize api and containts product xml (ServerCode/products/Schreibtisch.xml)
- you might integrate servercode to your own system or rewrite completely
- ServerCode is intended for demo, so it is kept as simple as possible (ignoring code quality / coding style issues)
- InitProduct.php and LoadSettings.php are called via HTTP requests from AngularJS (app/dvconfig.js)
- for simplicity, we use CURL requests (might be not done in best style, but works for demo)

./src
- some Angular JS stuff, that is used by grunt to concat app/dvconfig.js

./widgets
- HTML widgets, that you can use to display features and attribute via the respective dvcoonfig.js Angular Directive
- have a look to ./css folder as well

./js, ./bootstrap
- some stuff like bootstrap, jquery etc to have a local copy (not necessary for online version, just for local dev)

Getting started:
================
1. edit ./ServerCode/settings_public.json (add your own Apikey and Token, you get them on www.davitec.de/dvconfig)
2. browse ./index.html
3. edit ./ServerCode/product/Schreibtisch.xml as you like
4. edit ./src to change dvconfig.js and grunt it (./Gruntfile.js)
